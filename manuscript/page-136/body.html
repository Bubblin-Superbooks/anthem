<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The house had two stories and a strange roof flat as a floor. There was more window than wall upon its walls, and the windows went on straight around the corners, though how this kept the house standing we could not guess. The walls were hard and smooth, of that stone unlike stone which we had seen in our tunnel.</p><p>We both knew it without words: this house was left from the Unmentionable Times. The trees had protected it from time and weather, and from men who have less pity than time and weather. We turned to the Golden One and we asked:</p><p>"Are you afraid?"</p><p>But they shook their head. So we walked to the door, and we threw it open, and we stepped together into the house of the Unmentionable Times.</p></div> </div>
