<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Many words have been granted me, and some are wise, and some are false, but only three are holy: "I will it!"</p><p>Whatever road I take, the guiding star is within me; the guiding star and the loadstone which point the way. They point in but one direction. They point to me.</p><p>I know not if this earth on which I stand is the core of the universe or if it is but a speck of dust lost in eternity. I know not and I care not. For I know what happiness is possible to me on earth. And my happiness needs no higher aim to vindicate it. My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose.</p></div> </div>
