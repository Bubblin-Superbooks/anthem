<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We found a room with walls made of shelves, which held rows of manuscripts, from the floor to the ceiling. Never had we seen such a number of them, nor of such strange shape. They were not soft and rolled, they had hard shells of cloth and leather; and the letters on their pages were so small and so even that we wondered at the men who had such handwriting. We glanced through the pages, and we saw that they were written in our language, but we found many words which we could not understand. Tomorrow, we shall begin to read these scripts.</p><p>When we had seen all the rooms of the house, we looked at the Golden One and we both knew the thought in our minds.</p></div> </div>
