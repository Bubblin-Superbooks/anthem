<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Neither am I the means to any end others may wish to accomplish. I am not a tool for their use. I am not a servant of their needs. I am not a bandage for their wounds. I am not a sacrifice on their altars.</p><p>I am a man. This miracle of me is mine to own and keep, and mine to guard, and mine to use, and mine to kneel before!</p><p>I do not surrender my treasures, nor do I share them. The fortune of my spirit is not to be blown into coins of brass and flung to the winds as alms for the poor of the spirit. I guard my treasures: my thought, my will, my freedom. And the greatest of these is freedom.</p></div> </div>
