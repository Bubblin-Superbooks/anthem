<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Yet as we walked back to the Home of the Street Sweepers, we felt that we wanted to sing, without reason. So we were reprimanded tonight, in the dining hall, for without knowing it we had begun to sing aloud some tune we had never heard. But it is not proper to sing without reason, save at the Social Meetings.</p><p>"We are singing because we are happy," we answered the one of the Home Council who reprimanded us.</p><p>"Indeed you are happy," they answered. "How else can men be when they live for their brothers?"</p><p>And now, sitting here in our tunnel, we wonder about these words. It is forbidden, not to be happy. For, as it has been explained to us, men are free and the earth belongs to them; and all things on earth belong to all men; and the will of all men together is good for all; and so all men must be happy.</p></div> </div>
