<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Women work in the fields, and their white tunics in the wind are like the wings of sea-gulls beating over the black soil.</p><p>And there it was that we saw Liberty 5-3000 walking along the furrows. Their body was straight and thin as a blade of iron. Their eyes were dark and hard and glowing, with no fear in them, no kindness and no guilt. Their hair was golden as the sun; their hair flew in the wind, shining and wild, as if it defied men to restrain it. They threw seeds from their hand as if they deigned to fling a scornful gift, and the earth was a beggar under their feet.</p><p>We stood still; for the first time did we know fear, and then pain. And we stood still that we might not spill this pain more precious than pleasure.</p></div> </div>
