<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We stood together for a long time. And we were frightened that we had lived for twenty-one years and had never known what joy is possible to men.</p><p>Then we said:</p><p>"Our dearest one. Fear nothing of the forest. There is no danger in solitude. We have no need of our brothers. Let us forget their good and our evil, let us forget all things save that we are together and that there is joy as a bond between us. Give us your hand. Look ahead. It is our own world, Golden One, a strange, unknown world, but our own."</p><p>Then we walked on into the forest, their hand in ours.</p></div> </div>
