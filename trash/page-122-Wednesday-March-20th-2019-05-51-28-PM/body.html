<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We have not written for many days. We did not wish to speak. For we needed no words to remember that which has happened to us.</p><p>It was on our second day in the forest that we heard steps behind us. We hid in the bushes, and we waited. The steps came closer. And then we saw the fold of a white tunic among the trees, and a gleam of gold.</p><p>We leapt forward, we ran to them, and we stood looking upon the Golden One.</p><p>They saw us, and their hands closed into fists, and the fists pulled their arms down, as if they wished their arms to hold them, while their body swayed. And they could not speak.</p></div> </div>
