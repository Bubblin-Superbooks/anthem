They leapt to their feet, they ran from the table, and they stood pressed against the wall, huddled together, seeking the warmth of one another's bodies to give them courage.</p><p>We looked upon them and we laughed and said:</p><p>"Fear nothing, our brothers. There is a great power in these wires, but this power is tamed. It is yours. We give it to you."</p><p>Still they would not move.</p><p>"We give you the power of the sky!" we cried. "We give you the key to the earth! Take it, and let us be one of you, the humblest among you. Let us all work together, and harness this power, and make it ease the toil of men. Let us throw away our candles and our torches. Let us flood our cities with light. Let us bring a new light to men!"</p></div> </div>
