Twice have we been sent to the Palace of Mating, but it is an ugly and shameful matter, of which we do not like to think.</p><p>We had broken so many laws, and today we have broken one more. Today, we spoke to the Golden One.</p><p>The other women were far off in the field, when we stopped at the hedge by the side of the road. The Golden One were kneeling alone at the moat which runs through the field. And the drops of water falling from their hands, as they raised the water to their lips, were like sparks of fire in the sun. Then the Golden One saw us, and they did not move, kneeling there, looking at us, and circles of light played upon their white tunic, from the sun on the water of the moat, and one sparkling drop fell from a finger of their hand held as frozen in the air.</p></div> </div>
