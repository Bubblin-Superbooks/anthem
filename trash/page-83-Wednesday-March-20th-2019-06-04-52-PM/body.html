We saw a great painting on the wall over their heads, of the twenty illustrious men who had invented the candle.</p><p>All the heads of the Council turned to us as we entered. These great and wise of the earth did not know what to think of us, and they looked upon us with wonder and curiosity, as if we were a miracle. It is true that our tunic was torn and stained with brown stains which had been blood. We raised our right arm and we said:</p><p>"Our greeting to you, our honored brothers of the World Council of Scholars!"</p><p>Then Collective 0-0009, the oldest and wisest of the Council, spoke and asked:</p><p>"Who are you, our brother? For you do not look like a Scholar."</p></div> </div>
