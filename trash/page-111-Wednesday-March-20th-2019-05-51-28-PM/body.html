<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We had not thought of coming here, but our legs had carried our wisdom, and our legs had brought us to the Uncharted Forest against our will.</p><p>Our glass box lay beside us. We crawled to it, we fell upon it, our face in our arms, and we lay still.</p><p>We lay thus for a long time. Then we rose, we took our box and walked on into the forest.</p><p>It mattered not where we went. We knew that men would not follow us, for they never enter the Uncharted Forest. We had nothing to fear from them. The forest disposes of its own victims. This gave us no fear either. Only we wished to be away, away from the City and from the air that touches upon the air of the City. So we walked on, our box in our arms, our heart empty.</p></div> </div>
