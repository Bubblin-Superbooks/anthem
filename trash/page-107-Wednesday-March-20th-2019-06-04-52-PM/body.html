<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There is some error, one frightful error, in the thinking of men. What is that error? We do not know, but the knowledge struggles within us, struggles to be born. Today, the Golden One stopped suddenly and said:</p><p>"We love you."</p><p>But they frowned and shook their head and looked at us helplessly.</p><p>"No," they whispered, "that is not what we wished to say."</p><p>They were silent, then they spoke slowly, and their words were halting, like the words of a child learning to speak for the first time:</p><p>"We are one... alone... and only... and we love you who are one... alone... and only."</p><p>We looked into each other's eyes and we knew that the breath of a miracle had touched us, and fled, and left us groping vainly.</p></div> </div>
